	  MRC settings are normally written to NVRAM at BS_DEV_ENUMERATE-EXIT.
	  If a platform requires MRC settings written to NVRAM later than

	  BS_OS_RESUME_CHECK-ENTRY.

	  Instead of writing back MRC_CACHE training data back to the
	  MRC_CACHE right away, stash the data into cbmem.  This data
	  will be written back later to MRC_CACHE.  This is selected
	  for platforms which either do not support writes to SPI
	  flash in early stages
	  (BOOT_DEVICE_SPI_FLASH_NO_EARLY_WRITES) or the platforms
	  that need to write back the MRC data in late ramstage boot
	  states (MRC_WRITE_NV_LATE).

	  Use the MRC version info from FSP extended header to store the MRC cache data.
	  This method relies on the FSP_PRODUCER_DATA_TABLES belongs to the
	  `FspProducerDataHeader.h`file to get the MRC version.

	  Supported platform can retrieve the MRC version by directly parsing the binary.
