config MEDIATEK_DRAM_DVFS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option enables DRAM calibration with multiple frequencies (low,
	  medium and high frequency groups, with total 7 frequencies) for DVFS
	  feature. All supported data rates are: 800, 1200, 1600, 1866, 2400,
	  3200, 4266.

config MEDIATEK_DRAM_DVFS_LIMIT_FREQ_CNT
	bool

	help
	  This options limit DRAM frequency calibration count from total 7 to 3,
	  other frequency will directly use the low frequency shu result.

config MEDIATEK_BLOB_FAST_INIT
	bool "Enable running fast calibration by blob"
	default n
	help
	  This option allows performing fast calibration through different
	  open-source policy.

config MEMORY_TEST
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This option enables memory basic compare test to verify the DRAM read
	  or write is as expected.

config DPM_FOUR_CHANNEL
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option enables four channel configuration for DPM.

config MTK_DFD
	bool "Enable MediaTek DFD (Design For Debug) settings"
	help
	  DFD (Design for Debug) is a debugging tool, which scans flip-flops
	  and dumps to internal RAM on the WDT reset. We reserve 1MB on DRAM
	  to store logs of DFD.

config USE_CBMEM_DRAM_INFO
	bool "Support filling dram information to cbmem"
	help
	  The DRAM initialization will keep and return DRAM information (size,
	  geometry and other DDR info) so we can fill that into the CBMEM.
