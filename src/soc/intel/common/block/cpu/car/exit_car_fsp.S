 * This path for CAR teardown is taken when CONFIG_FSP_CAR is employed.
 * This version of chipset_teardown_car sets up the stack, then bypasses
 * the rest of arch/x86/exit_car.S and calls main() itself instead of
 * returning to _start. In main(), the TempRamExit FSP API is called
 * to tear down the CAR and set up caching which can be overwritten
 * after the API call.  More info can be found in the FSP Integration
 * Guide included with the FSP binary.
