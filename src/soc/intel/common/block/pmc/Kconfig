	  This should be disabled for devices running on battery since
	  it can draw much power. Further, it must be disabled, if S0ix
	  is enabled.

	  Disabling this option also stops the hardware TCO timer and makes
	  the TCO watchdog unavailable.

	  Note: On platforms without uCode PM Timer emulation, legacy OSes
	        or payloads with ACPI version < 5.0A might not work without
	        PM ACPI timer.

	        (Legacy) software requiring `TMR_STS` (for timer overflow
	        interrupts) will not work with this option disabled.
