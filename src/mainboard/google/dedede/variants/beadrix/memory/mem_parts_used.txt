# This is a CSV file containing a list of memory parts used by this variant.
# One part per line with an optional fixed ID in column 2.
# Only include a fixed ID if it is required for legacy reasons!
# Generated IDs are dependent on the order of parts in this file,
# so new parts must always be added at the end of the file!
#
# Generate an updated Makefile.inc and dram_id.generated.txt by running the
# gen_part_id tool from util/spd_tools/{ddr4,lp4x}.
# See util/spd_tools/{ddr4,lp4x}/README.md for more details and instructions.
