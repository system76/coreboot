	help
	 This option uses common MP infrastructure for bringing up APs
	 in parallel. It additionally provides a more flexible mechanism
	 for sequencing the steps of bringing up the APs.
	 The code also works for just initialising the BSP in case there
	 are no APs.

config TSC_SYNC_LFENCE
	bool

	  The CPU driver should select this if the CPU needs
	  to execute an lfence instruction in order to synchronize
	  rdtsc. This is true for all modern AMD CPUs.

config TSC_SYNC_MFENCE
	bool

	help
	  The CPU driver should select this if the CPU needs

	  rdtsc. This is true for all modern Intel CPUs.

config SETUP_XIP_CACHE
	bool

	help
	  Select this option to set up an MTRR to cache XIP stages loaded
	  from the bootblock. This is useful on platforms lacking a
	  non-eviction mode and therefore need to be careful to avoid
	  eviction.

config SERIALIZED_SMM_INITIALIZATION
	bool
	default n
	help
	  On some CPUs, there is a race condition in SMM.
	  This can occur when both hyperthreads change SMM state
	  variables in parallel without coordination.
	  Setting this option serializes the SMM initialization
	  to avoid an ugly hang in the boot process at the cost
	  of a slightly longer boot time.

config X86_AMD_FIXED_MTRRS

	  This option informs the MTRR code to use the RdMem and WrMem fields
	  in the fixed MTRR MSRs.

config X86_INIT_NEED_1_SIPI
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option limits the number of SIPI signals sent during during the
	  common AP setup.  Intel documentation specifies an INIT SIPI SIPI
	  sequence, however this doesn't work on some AMD and Intel platforms.
	  These newer AMD and Intel platforms don't need the 10ms wait between
	  INIT and SIPI, so skip that too to save some time.

config SOC_SETS_MSRS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The SoC requires different access methods for reading and writing
	  the MSRs.  Use SoC specific routines to handle the MSR access.

config RESERVE_MTRRS_FOR_OS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option allows a platform to reserve 2 MTRRs for the OS usage.
	  The Intel SDM documents that the the first 6 MTRRs are intended for
	  the system BIOS and the last 2 are to be reserved for OS usage.
	  However, modern OSes use PAT to control cacheability instead of
	  using MTRRs.

config CPU_INFO_V2
	bool
	depends on PARALLEL_MP
	help
	  Enables the new method of locating struct cpu_info. This new method
	  uses the %gs segment to locate the cpu_info pointer. The old method
	  relied on the stack being CONFIG_STACK_SIZE aligned.
