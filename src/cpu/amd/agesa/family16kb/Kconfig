		Force AGESA to ignore package type mismatch between CPU and northbridge
		in memory code. This enables Socket AM1 support with current AGESA
		version for Kabini platform.
		Enable this option only if you have Socket AM1 board.
		Note that the AGESA release shipped with coreboot does not officially
		support the AM1 socket. Selecting this option might damage your hardware.
