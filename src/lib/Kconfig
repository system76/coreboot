config MISSING_BOARD_RESET
	bool
	help
	  Selected by boards that don't provide a do_board_reset()
	  implementation. This activates a stub that logs the missing
	  board reset and halts execution.

config RAMSTAGE_ADA
	bool
	help
	  Selected by features that use Ada code in ramstage.

config RAMSTAGE_LIBHWBASE
	bool
	select RAMSTAGE_ADA
	help
	  Selected by features that require `libhwbase` in ramstage.

config FLATTENED_DEVICE_TREE
	bool
	help
	  Selected by features that require to parse and manipulate a flattened
	  devicetree in ramstage.

config HAVE_SPD_IN_CBFS
	bool
	help
	  If enabled, add support for adding spd.hex files in cbfs as spd.bin
	  and locating it runtime to load SPD.

config DIMM_MAX
	int
	default 4
	help
	  Total number of memory DIMM slots available on motherboard.
	  It is multiplication of number of channel to number of DIMMs per
	  channel

config DIMM_SPD_SIZE
	int
	default 256
	help
	  Total SPD size that will be used for DIMM.
	  Ex: DDR3 256, DDR4 512.

config SPD_READ_BY_WORD
	bool

config SPD_CACHE_IN_FMAP
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Enables capability to cache DIMM SPDs in a dedicated FMAP region
	  to speed loading of SPD data. Currently requires board-level
	  romstage implementation to read/write/utilize cached SPD data.
	  When the default FMAP is used, will create a region named RW_SPD_CACHE
	  to store the cached SPD data.

config SPD_CACHE_FMAP_NAME
	string
	depends on SPD_CACHE_IN_FMAP
	default "RW_SPD_CACHE"
	help
	  Name of the FMAP region created in the default FMAP to cache SPD data.

config NO_FMAP_CACHE
	bool
	help
	  If your platform really doesn't want to use an FMAP cache (e.g. due to
	  space constraints), you can select this to disable warnings and save
	  a bit more code.

config ESPI_DEBUG
	bool
	help
	  This option enables eSPI library helper functions for displaying debug
	  information.

config NO_CBFS_MCACHE
	bool
	help
	  Disables the CBFS metadata cache. This means that your platform does
	  not need to provide a CBFS_MCACHE section in memlayout and can save
	  the associated CAR/SRAM size. In that case every single CBFS file
	  lookup must re-read the same CBFS directory entries from flash to find
	  the respective file.

config CBFS_CACHE_ALIGN
	int
	default 8
	help
	  Sets the alignment of the buffers returned by the cbfs_cache.

config CBFS_PRELOAD
	bool
	depends on COOP_MULTITASKING
	help
	  When enabled it will be possible to preload CBFS files into the
	  cbfs_cache. This helps reduce boot time by loading the files
	  in the background before they are actually required. This feature
	  depends on the read-only boot_device having a DMA controller to
	  perform the background transfer.
