/* The coreboot table information is for conveying information
 * from the firmware to the loaded OS image.  Primarily this
 * is expected to be information that cannot be discovered by
 * other means, such as querying the hardware directly.
 *
 * All of the information should be Position Independent Data.
 * That is it should be safe to relocated any of the information
 * without it's meaning/correctness changing.   For table that
 * can reasonably be used on multiple architectures the data
 * size should be fixed.  This should ease the transition between
 * 32 bit and 64 bit architectures etc.
 *
 * The completeness test for the information in this table is:
 * - Can all of the hardware be detected?
 * - Are the per motherboard constants available?
 * - Is there enough to allow a kernel to run that was written before
 *   a particular motherboard is constructed? (Assuming the kernel
 *   has drivers for all of the hardware but it does not have
 *   assumptions on how the hardware is connected together).
 *
 * With this test it should be straight forward to determine if a
 * table entry is required or not.  This should remove much of the
 * long term compatibility burden as table entries which are
 * irrelevant or have been replaced by better alternatives may be
 * dropped.  Of course it is polite and expedite to include extra
 * table entries and be backwards compatible, but it is not required.

/**
 * coreboot framebuffer
 *
 * The coreboot framebuffer uses a very common format usually referred
 * to as "linear framebuffer":
 *
 * The first pixel of the framebuffer is the upper left corner, its
 * address is given by `physical_address`.
 *
 * Each pixel is represented by exactly `bits_per_pixel` bits. If a
 * pixel (or a color component therein) doesn't fill a whole byte or
 * doesn't start on a byte boundary, it starts at the least signifi-
 * cant bit not occupied by the previous pixel (or color component).
 * Pixels (or color components) that span multiple bytes always start
 * in the byte with the lowest address.
 *
 * The framebuffer provides a visible rectangle of `x_resolution` *
 * `y_resolution` pixels. However, the lines always start at a byte
 * boundary given by `bytes_per_line`, which may leave a gap after
 * each line of pixels. Thus, the data for a pixel with the coordi-
 * nates (x, y) from the upper left corner always starts at
 *
 *   physical_address + y * bytes_per_line + x * bits_per_pixel / 8
 *
 * `bytes_per_line` is always big enough to hold `x_resolution`
 * pixels. It can, however, be arbitrarily higher (e.g. to fulfill
 * hardware constraints or for optimization purposes). The size of
 * the framebuffer is always `y_resolution * bytes_per_line`.
 *
 * The coreboot framebuffer only supports RGB color formats. The
 * position and size of each color component are specified indivi-
 * dually by <color>_mask_pos and <color>_mask_size. To allow byte
 * or word aligned pixels, a fourth (padding) component may be
 * specified by `reserved_mask_pos` and `reserved_mask_size`.
 *
 * Software utilizing the coreboot framebuffer shall consider all
 * fields described above. It may, however, only implement a subset
 * of the possible color formats.
